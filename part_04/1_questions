Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?
An array is used to store a collection of data of variables of the same type.

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?

String cats [] = new String [10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?
An array of arrays.

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?

int scores [] [] = new int [6] [6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?

System.out.println("10th item in dogs array: "
                           + dogs[9]);

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?

Array boundaries are strictly enforced. This exception will terminate program if you mess this up

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.

int array.length-1;

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?

java uses int as the default for arrays. the max size is the max size for integers

9) What is a bubble sort?

Its a sorting algorithm for arrays

10) How does a bubble sort work?

It uses a process of repeated comparing element of arrays with each other and sending larger ones in one direction
and smaller ones in another

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.


        int[] years = new int[2018];

        for (int i = 1; i < 2018; i++) {

            years[i] = i;
            System.out.println(years[i]);


13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.

                int x =0;
                int [] years;
                    while(x < years.length){
                        System.out.println("x is : " + x);
                        x++;
                    }

14) What is a queue?

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?
. It is an ordered list of objects with its use limited to inserting elements at the
   end of list and deleting elements from the start of list

16) What is a stack?
It is a collection that is based on the last in first out (LIFO) principle

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?

In a stack, an object is pushed on top of the collection during insertion operation.
In a queue, new object is inserted at the end.
An object is removed from a stack from the top. In queue, object is removed from the beginning.

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?

You use these when you want to iterate over an array or arraylist

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?

Java provides Collection Framework which defines several classes and interfaces to represent a
group of objects as a single unit.

Collection interface
Map interface

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
  int arr[][] = { {2,7,9},{3,6,1},{7,4,2} };

  for (int i=0; i< 3 ; i++)
          {
              for (int j=0; j < 3 ; j++)
                  System.out.print(arr[i][j] + " ");

              System.out.println();
          }


21) What is a String?

A sequence of characters

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?

.length()  //returns the length of a string
.toLowerCase() //converts to lower case
.toUpperCase() // convers to upper case

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?

Strings can't be changed once they are created

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
